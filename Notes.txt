* Alembic.Metrics

** Introduction

Alembic.Metrics is intended to be a simple drop-in mechanism for collecting metrics; holding them in a circular buffer; persisting them to disk; and plotting them up for comparison.

It's not intended to replace enterprise-scale solutions like NetIQ. Instead, it's something you might use as a minimum-configuration alternative while getting an enterprise-scale system in place.

It's not as fully featured as something like RRD. It was developed after a frustrating period trying to get RRD working in Windows, and to minimise the number of external requirements (it only requires .NET 4).

It allows you to develop plugin sources of data that can be managed in the same way as the packaged sources.

** Using packaged sources

** Plotting timeseries from multiple sources on the same chart

** Fine-grained control over sources, sinks, chains and schedules

** Recovering and plotting persisted data; scaling out across multiple machines

** Creating your own data source

Your source should implement ISnapshotProvider. A snapshot is a list of one or more data points.

Your source -- and any automatically-created sinks, chains and schedules -- should implement ISimpleBuilder.

Example: a web service query perhaps, that uses hardcoded paramaters. Add the standard sink set in builder?

Extend to act on configuration.
