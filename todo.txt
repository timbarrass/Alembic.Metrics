. Separate plotting responsibility from data sink
/ Typed MetricData and generic sink
/ Enable enumeration of sink
/ Check service installation, uninstallation [need to be admin?]
. Sketch out remote interface
. Enable new source plugins
/ Uptime needs to handle case where process goes while querying for times
/ have source.Query return an IEnumerable<IMetricData> (require sorted on timestamp?)
/ have sink.Update accept an IEnumerable<IMetricData>
1 have sinks maintain a buffer per source (set of specs) [breaks direct IEnumerator implementation, but should be able to get an enumerator for a buffer]
. make sinks configurable -- link with source, start with number of points remembered
. have sink recall latest recent timestamp, and not reimport data before then (wasteful)
/ generic SqlServer database source -- get timeseries data
. move to async source query, register handlers with sink
/ multithread source query
