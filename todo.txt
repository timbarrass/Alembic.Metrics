SimplePlotterElement etc to provide PlotterId, BufferId, StoreId properties etc for subscribing classes to use

Support multi-value snapshots
  At Simple* config level we want it handled automatically
    Will need labels for values
  At detailed config level assume that sinks accept all points that sources produce -- is there another use case?
  Sources still just provide a snapshot
    Source label no longer describes all data from source; need value labels
	At detailed config level need value labels
  Sinks still accept a snapshot
    x At detailed config level need value labels (independent of sources ...) [self describing snapshots]
  New dimension for MetricData, or a list of values? Assume all values associated with same time point and -> list of values, order must match labels

  Or can snapshot include label information? Self describing data would mean that sinks don't need to be preconfigured with labels.

  "simpler", as the stores just hold collections of snapshots. potentially wasteful in terms of memory (stores could downconvert to a more optimized form for persistence)

  1. MetricData takes a list of values; maintain current functionality by sources/sinks only populating/using first value
  2. Snapshots extended to include a list of value labels (unused)
  3. Sources populate snapshot value labels for single current value
  4. Sources populate snapshot value labels based on configured labels
  4. Most sinks ok -- plotter needs to plot all, using labels
  5.
