4. Spin off example html5/js/css3 app like mashup? charting controls?
5. Watermark on (large) plots
6. Dynamic sink discovery
7. Plotter with important event labelling (from some source .. represent as a snapshot?)
8. SQL server store?
9. Integrity; what if source/sink change configuration between stop and start?
9a. First step, compare and warn, most can be fixed manually at the moment
9b. Fix automatically where possible
