1. Reconsider exception handling. Currently MetricAgent should die at first unhandled exception. Schedules map to thread boundaries. Should they insulate app from exceptions?
2. MultiPlotter -- final step might be nice to define multi-area charts.
3. Store -- rewrite whole store on Update is wasteful. Define archive behaviour (points, as buffer?). Modify store to update and roll-off.
4. Spin off example html5/js/css3 app like mashup? charting controls?
